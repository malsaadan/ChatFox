# GA Project#2: ChatFox 

This project was built as a requirement in Misk Academy-General Assembly Software Engineering Course.

## Planning

At first, I was going to call a chatbot API which has some commands for the chatbot, and in my web app I would let the user edit or delete a command or all of the commands, and interact with the chatbot. Each time the user query a phrase or a question, the chatbot would call its api for the response. But as I was exploring different apis, I couldn't find a chatbot the meets my requirements, so I made the queries inside the chatbot itself.


## Future Work

1. Make the chatbot more advanced, where it takes multiple responses for a phrase and returns a random one.

2. Implement notification messages when adding a command and a confirmation message when attempting to delete a/all command(s).

## Favorite functionality

My favorite functionality and the most complex one in this project, is displaying the chat where the user send a message and the bot responds.
